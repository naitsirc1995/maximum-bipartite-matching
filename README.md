# maximum-bipartite-matching

### The problem. 

Given a bipartite graph  G = (V,E) , we want to find a set of edges in such a way that no two edges share an endpoint. Here is an illustration of what we would have to do. 


This is an example of a random bipartite graph.

For the given bipartite , the following edges do not share an endpoint.

Looking for edges with the property just described is trivialm, but looking 
for the **MAXIMUM** number of edges with such property is not trivial.
